/**
 * `createRedactingLogMethodWith`: a pino `hooks.logMethod` (pinned against
 * pino `10.3.1` — the only version this reasoning was ever confirmed
 * against — https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/main/docs/api.md#hooks and
 * https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/main/lib/tools.js) that redacts a
 * secret out of the message, every string field of a merging object, and a
 * serialized `err.message`, before pino ever serializes or writes the line.
 *
 * `hooks.logMethod` is the only pino extension point that sees the raw
 * message: `formatters.log(obj)` looked like the natural fit at first, but
 * reading `lib/tools.js`'s `_asJson` shows `formatters.log` never receives
 * `msg` at all (pino serializes the message key separately from the
 * merged object) and runs *before* `serializers[key]` — so a `formatters`
 * hook can redact a plain string field, but never the message, and never
 * a value an `err` serializer hasn't produced yet. `hooks.logMethod`,
 * documented as `logMethod (args, method, level) {}`, instead wraps the
 * log call itself (`lib/tools.js`'s `genLog`: `hook.call(this, args, LOG,
 * level)`) before pino does anything — before merging, before
 * serializers, before `formatters.log`, before the configured
 * path-based `redact`. Redacting here and then calling `method.apply`
 * with the redacted arguments means every later pino stage (including a
 * host's own `redact` option, still applied by path) runs unchanged on
 * text pino can no longer see in the clear.
 *
 * `args` is exactly what the caller passed to `logger.info(...)` et al.:
 * `(msg, ...interpolationValues)`, `(mergingObject, msg,
 * ...interpolationValues)`, or a bare `Error`. Before anything is scanned,
 * `joinInterpolatedMessage` (below) joins a string `msg` followed by
 * further positional arguments into the single string pino's own
 * `quick-format-unescaped` would produce (`./format-message.ts`), *before*
 * redaction runs, so a secret split across the format string and an
 * interpolation value — or across two interpolation values — is scanned
 * as one leaf, not two that never individually match. Everything from
 * that point on — the joined message, a merging object, or a normalized
 * `Error` — is one value tree, redacted with `maskLogValueWith`
 * (`@redact-secret/adapter`), so:
 *
 * - the joined message, or a plain string `msg` with nothing to join, is
 *   redacted as one leaf;
 * - every string field of a merging object is redacted, at any depth;
 * - an `Error` anywhere in the tree — including a bare `logger.error(err)`
 *   call — is replaced by an already-redacted `{ type, message, stack,
 *   ...ownProps }` object, in the shape `pino.stdSerializers.err` would
 *   have produced, before that serializer (or any other) ever sees the
 *   real message or stack.
 *
 * A bare leading `Error` (`logger.error(err)`) is normalized to
 * `[{ err }, err.message, ...rest]` first: pino's own `write()` infers
 * `msg` from `err.message` only when the first argument is `instanceof
 * Error`, and replacing that argument with our masked plain object (which
 * is not `instanceof Error`) would silently drop the `msg` field from the
 * output. Normalizing first keeps that shape — both the `err` object and
 * a top-level `msg` — with everything inside already redacted. Joining
 * runs after this normalization, uniformly, over whatever shape results.
 *
 * `await initialize()` (`@redact-secret/core`) must resolve before the
 * returned hook is used; `./index.ts`'s `createRedactingLogMethod`
 * enforces that ordering for the live integration. This file is
 * dependency-injected and testable without the native addon built; pino
 * appears here as a type import only, never as a value import.
